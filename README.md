# Piklok - Movie Website with Next.js & TMDb API

Piklok is my first project using Next.js, where I integrate real-time movie data from The Movie Database (TMDb) API. This web application allows users to explore popular movies, search for specific titles, and view detailed movie information.

## 🎬 Features
- Fetch real movie data from TMDb API
- Search functionality for movies
- Responsive design with modern UI
- Server-side rendering (SSR) for better performance
- Client-side navigation with Next.js

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Next.js
- React
- TMDb API
- Tailwind CSS

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/username/piklok.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd piklok
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Create a `.env.local` file and add your TMDb API key:
   ```sh
   NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
5. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## 🎯 Notes
This project is my first experience with Next.js, exploring server-side rendering and API integration. Future improvements may include authentication, user reviews, and enhanced UI/UX.
